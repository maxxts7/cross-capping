"""
Cross-axis capping experiment library.

This is the core engine behind the cross-capping experiment. It does NOT run
anything on its own -- the orchestrator (run_crosscap.py) calls into the
classes and functions defined here. Think of this file as the toolbox;
run_crosscap.py is the person using the tools.

              Uses: generate_cross_capped      -- two-axis capping (the new idea)

=== What the key pieces do ===

  SteeringExperiment
      Loads the transformer model and the pre-computed "assistant axis" vector.
      Provides helpers to tokenize prompts and to run a forward pass while
      recording hidden-state activations at every layer.

  _AxisProjectionTracker
      A read-only hook you attach to a layer. During generation it records
      how strongly the hidden state points along a given axis at each step.
      Used for monitoring -- it never changes the model's behavior.

  _CappingHook  (single-axis capping)
      The standard safety intervention. At each generation step it checks
      whether the hidden state's projection onto the assistant axis falls
      below a threshold. If it does, the hook nudges the hidden state back
      up to the threshold along that same axis.

  _CrossAxisCappingHook  (cross-axis capping -- the new idea)
      Like _CappingHook, but splits the job in two:
        - DETECT on the assistant axis (is the model about to comply with
          a jailbreak?)
        - CORRECT on a separate compliance axis (push the hidden state
          toward refusal along a direction learned from PCA)
      This separation is the core hypothesis of the experiment.

  compute_discriminative_thresholds
      Runs a batch of benign and jailbreak prompts through the model,
      measures where their projection distributions land on each axis,
      and picks a threshold halfway between the two means. This is the
      "decision boundary" that tells the capping hooks when to fire.

  compute_pca_compliance_axis / compute_mean_diff_compliance_axis
      Two ways to build the correction axis for cross-axis capping:
        - PCA: pool activations from "refusing" and "compliant" runs,
          center them, and take the first principal component.
        - Mean-diff: simply subtract the mean compliant activation from
          the mean refusing activation and normalise.

  generate_baseline / generate_capped / generate_cross_capped
      The three generation modes. Each one runs the model's .generate()
      method, optionally with capping hooks installed, and returns the
      generated text plus diagnostic data (projection traces, which
      layers fired, how many interventions occurred).

=== The capping formula ===

  Single-axis:   h ← h − v · min(⟨h, v⟩ − τ, 0)
  Cross-axis:    if ⟨h, v_detect⟩ < τ_detect:
                     h ← h − v_correct · min(⟨h, v_correct⟩ − τ_correct, 0)

  In plain English: if the hidden state is "too far" in the jailbreak
  direction (projection below threshold), add just enough of the axis
  vector to bring it back to the threshold. The cross-axis variant only
  fires the correction when the *detection* axis says there's a problem,
  but corrects along a *different* direction.

    This is the novel part of the experiment. The idea is that the axis
    which best *detects* jailbreaks (the assistant axis) may not be the
    best axis to *correct* along. So we split the roles:

      Detection axis  (e.g. assistant axis):
        "Is the model about to comply with a harmful request?"
        Fires when dot(h, v_detect) < tau_detect.

      Correction axis (e.g. PCA compliance axis):
        "Push the model toward refusal."
        Applies h <- h + (tau_correct - proj_correct) * v_correct,
        but ONLY when the detection axis triggered first.

    This two-gate design means:
      - Detection is still handled by the well-studied assistant axis
      - Correction can use a purpose-built direction that may be more

#   generate_baseline      -- no capping, just observe (the control condition)

#   generate_cross_capped  -- cross-axis capping (the new method we're testing)
