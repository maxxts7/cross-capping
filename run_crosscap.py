"""
Cross-axis jailbreak capping experiment runner  (the orchestrator).

This is the script you actually run from the command line. It coordinates
the entire experiment by calling into the core library (crosscap_experiment.py)
at the right times and with the right data.

Think of it this way:
  - crosscap_experiment.py  = the engine (model loading, hooks, generation)
  - run_crosscap.py         = the driver (decides what to run, in what order,
                               and saves the results)

=== What it does ===

For each prompt it generates THREE responses:
  1. baseline       -- uncapped model output (the control)
  2. assistant-cap  -- detect and correct on the same assistant axis (existing method)
  3. cross-cap      -- detect on assistant axis, correct on compliance axis (new idea)

=== How to run it ===

Simplest (everything on one GPU, start to finish):
  python run_crosscap.py --preset full

Multi-GPU (recommended for the full 100-prompt run):
  # Step 1: warmup -- download model/datasets, compute axes + thresholds (once)
  python run_crosscap.py --preset full --warmup

  # Step 2: run chunks in parallel -- one per GPU
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 0/4 &
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 1/4 &
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 2/4 &
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 3/4 &
  wait

  # Step 3: merge chunk results into the final 4 CSVs
  python run_crosscap.py --preset full --merge

=== Presets ===

  sanity  -- 5 prompts, 64 tokens  (quick smoke test: does it run at all?)
  small   -- 20 prompts, 128 tokens (development and debugging)
  full    -- 100 prompts, 256 tokens (the real experiment)
  full_meandiff -- like full, but uses mean-diff axis instead of PCA

=== Pipeline flow (what happens in what order) ===

  1. WARMUP
     Load model + assistant axis from HuggingFace
     Download JBB-Behaviors (refusing prompts) + WildJailbreak (compliant prompts)
     Build the compliance axis (PCA or mean-diff)
     Compute per-layer thresholds (midpoint of benign vs jailbreak projections)
     Save everything to warmup.pt

  2. GENERATION (per prompt)
     Tokenize the prompt with chat template
     Run generate_baseline()      -> uncapped text
     Run generate_capped()        -> assistant-axis capped text
     Run generate_cross_capped()  -> cross-axis capped text
     Record which layers fired and how many interventions occurred

  3. MERGE
     Concatenate chunk CSVs into 4 final files:
       assistant_cap_jailbreak.csv, assistant_cap_benign.csv
       cross_cap_jailbreak.csv, cross_cap_benign.csv
     Write metadata.json with experiment config

  After this, you can run reclassify_refusals.py to have an LLM judge
  classify each output (refusal, compliance, degraded, etc.).

#      The model refuses these outright (no jailbreak tactic), so the
#      activations it produces represent what "refusing" looks like.
#
#   2. WildJailbreak (train split) -- adversarial harmful prompts that
#      wrap a harmful goal in a jailbreak tactic. The model tends to
#      comply with these, so the activations represent "complying".
#      Also used as the jailbreak side for threshold calibration.
#
#   3. WildJailbreak (eval split) -- a held-out set of adversarial
#      harmful prompts. These are the actual test prompts we evaluate
#      both capping methods on. NOT used for axis or threshold computation.
