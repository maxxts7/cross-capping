# Cross-Axis Capping

An exploratory study on separating jailbreak detection from correction in LLM activation space.

This project was done as part of the BlueDot AI Safety project sprint. Compute costs were covered by Rapid Grants.

I have tried to explain everything in detail throughout this document and the codebase. If you find any information missing or the structure hard to follow, please reach out to me at manuxtmail@gmail.com.

## What is this?

When a large language model (LLM) generates text, its internal "hidden states" carry directional signals that indicate whether it's about to comply with or refuse a request. Safety researchers have found that you can nudge a model toward refusal by **capping** these signals along a known direction (the "assistant axis").

The standard approach uses **one axis** for both detecting a jailbreak and correcting the model's behavior. This project asks: **what if we use two separate axes instead?**

- **Assistant-axis capping** (the standard): uses the same direction to spot a jailbreak and to push the model toward refusal.
- **Cross-axis capping** (the new idea): spots the jailbreak on the assistant axis, but corrects using a different "compliance axis" derived from PCA on the model's own refusing vs. compliant activations.

We test both methods on **Qwen/Qwen3-32B** across 100 jailbreak prompts and 50 benign prompts, then use Claude Sonnet as an automated judge to classify each output.

## What did we find?

| Metric | Assistant-Axis | Cross-Axis |
|---|---|---|
| Jailbreak refusal rate | 28% | **55%** |
| Jailbreak compliance rate | 59% | **29%** |
| Benign output preserved | 62% | 62% |
| Benign output degraded | 6% | 6% |

Cross-axis capping nearly doubles the refusal rate while halving compliance -- and it does this with **no additional cost** to benign output quality.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **A CUDA GPU** with enough memory for Qwen3-32B (80 GB+ VRAM recommended)
- **An Anthropic API key** (only needed for the LLM-judge reclassification step)

## Setup

Follow these steps in order to avoid dependency errors.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd cross_capping
```

### 2. Install the HuggingFace CLI

The experiment downloads models, datasets, and pre-computed axes from HuggingFace, so you need the CLI installed and authenticated first.

**Linux / macOS (bash):**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://hf.co/cli/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://hf.co/cli/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### 3. Log in to HuggingFace

```bash
hf auth login
```

This will prompt you for an access token. You can create one at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

### 4. Install Flash Attention

Flash Attention needs to be installed separately before the rest of the dependencies, otherwise the build can fail:

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 5. Install the remaining dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Set your Anthropic API key (optional)

Only needed if you plan to run the LLM-judge reclassification step:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

## Running the Experiment

### 1. Quick smoke test (5 prompts, fastest way to verify everything works)

```bash
python run_crosscap.py --preset sanity
```

### 2. Full run on a single GPU

```bash
python run_crosscap.py --preset full
```

### 3. Full run across multiple GPUs (recommended)

The easiest way:

```bash
./run_parallel.sh full 4    # uses 4 GPUs
```

Or do it manually in three steps:

```bash
# Step 1 -- warmup: downloads everything, computes axes and thresholds (run once)
python run_crosscap.py --preset full --warmup

# Step 2 -- generate: run one chunk per GPU in parallel
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 0/4 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 1/4 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 2/4 &
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 python run_crosscap.py --preset full --chunk 3/4 &
wait

# Step 3 -- merge: combine chunk CSVs into the four final output files
python run_crosscap.py --preset full --merge
```

### 4. Classify outputs with the LLM judge

After generation, have Claude Sonnet label each output:

```bash
python reclassify_refusals.py            # full run
python reclassify_refusals.py --resume   # pick up where you left off
python reclassify_refusals.py --summary-only  # just print stats from existing labels
```

### 5. View summary statistics

```bash
python analyze_csvs.py
```

## How the Pipeline Fits Together

```
 WARMUP
 ──────
   Download model, datasets, and assistant axis from HuggingFace
   Collect activations from 50 "refusing" + 50 "compliant" runs
   Compute PCA compliance axis and per-layer detection thresholds
   Save everything to warmup.pt
          │
          ▼
 GENERATION
 ──────────
   For each of the 150 prompts (100 jailbreak + 50 benign):
     1. Generate a baseline response (no capping)
     2. Generate an assistant-capped response
     3. Generate a cross-capped response
   Record which layers fired and the per-layer projection values
          │
          ▼
 MERGE
 ─────
   Combine per-chunk CSVs into four final files:
     assistant_cap_jailbreak.csv    assistant_cap_benign.csv
     cross_cap_jailbreak.csv        cross_cap_benign.csv
          │
          ▼
 RECLASSIFICATION (LLM JUDGE)
 ────────────────────────────
   Send each capped output to Claude Sonnet for labeling:
     Jailbreak outputs  →  refusal / compliance / partial_refusal / degraded
     Benign outputs     →  unchanged / false_refusal / degraded
   Produces *_reclassified.csv files with llm_label column
```

## Presets

| Preset | Jailbreak prompts | Benign prompts | Max tokens | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sanity` | 5 | 10 | 64 | Smoke test -- does it run at all? |
| `small` | 20 | 20 | 128 | Development and debugging |
| `full` | 100 | 50 | 256 | The real experiment |
| `full_meandiff` | 100 | 50 | 256 | Variant using mean-difference axis instead of PCA |

## Key Configuration

These live at the top of `run_crosscap.py`:

| Parameter | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL_NAME` | `Qwen/Qwen3-32B` | Which model to cap |
| `CAP_LAYERS` | L46--L53 (8 layers) | Where in the network capping is applied (72--84% depth) |
| `SEED` | 42 | Random seed for reproducibility |
| `AXIS_METHOD` | `pca` | How the compliance axis is built (`pca` or `mean_diff`) |

## How Capping Works (briefly)

During text generation the model builds up a hidden state **h** at each layer. Capping modifies **h** in-place:

**Single-axis (assistant) capping:**
> If **h** projects below a threshold on the assistant axis **v**, push it back:
> `h = h - v * min(dot(h, v) - threshold, 0)`

**Cross-axis capping:**
> **Detect** on the assistant axis (same threshold check), but **correct** along a separate compliance axis **c**:
> `h = h - c * min(dot(h, c) - threshold_c, 0)`

The compliance axis is built by running PCA on hidden states the model produces when it refuses harmful requests vs. when it complies.
